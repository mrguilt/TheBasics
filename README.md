# The Basics

Working through learning Swift, much as I had my attempt at Rust. This is starting with [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/) and [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics) sections of the documentation (though it may spill beyond that).

    * Did some variable assignment and printing
    * Played with Arrays. The index of the first element is 0
        * It works in an object-oriented way. So, `arrayname.count`, `arrayname.append`, etc.
