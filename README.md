# The Basics

Working through learning Swift, much as I had my attempt at Rust. This is starting with [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/) and [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics) sections of the documentation (though it has spilled beyond that).

    * Did some variable assignment and printing
        * Variable names can be Emoji, which just seems wrong. Also: it has to be pure Emoji. The tricks of setting gender, skin tone, coat color, etc. (which kinda combines two emoji) doesn't work. 
    * Played with Arrays. The index of the first element is 0
        * It works in an object-oriented way. So, `arrayname.count`, `arrayname.append`, etc.
    * Most operators are typical. 
        * The Nil-Coalescing Operator is interesting: "use x if y is nil; otherwise, use y"
